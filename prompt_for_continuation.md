# GTM Project Continuation Prompt

## What Has Been Done So Far

1. **Admin Login Fix Implementation**:
   - Created a simplified admin login system that bypasses the server-side authentication issues
   - Implemented client-side validation for "admin" username and "admin123" password
   - Created a basic admin dashboard with 4 buttons (admin-dashboard.html)
   - Used localStorage for maintaining login state

2. **Rules File Creation**:
   - Created a .rules file in the project root
   - Added rules for project development and workflow
   - Configured it to be updated whenever "add rule:" is typed
   - Ensured it will not be added to git or uploaded to GitHub

3. **Changes to auth.js**:
   - Modified authentication flow to handle direct admin login
   - Added localStorage for session persistence
   - Improved error handling with null checks
   - Added support for Enter key in login form

## What Needs to Be Done

1. **Enhanced Admin Dashboard**:
   - Improve styling with movie images in the background with proper opacity
   - Implement more relevant admin functions based on the TODO list
   - Functions should include movie management, user management, statistics, settings, etc.
   - Make buttons visually appealing and representative of their functions

2. **Working Logout Functionality**:
   - Complete the logout button functionality to clear localStorage
   - Add proper redirection after logout
   - Ensure all session data is properly cleared

3. **User Management Implementation**:
   - Create a user management interface
   - Allow viewing, adding, editing, and deleting users
   - Include fields for username, email, admin status, etc.
   - Implement proper validation and error handling

4. **Movie Management Implementation**:
   - Allow admins to add, edit, and delete movies
   - Include fields for movie title, release year, description, images, etc.
   - Implement image uploading or linking
   - Add proper validation and error handling

5. **Authentication Improvement (Future)**:
   - Replace the temporary client-side authentication with proper server-side authentication
   - Use secure HTTP-only cookies for session management
   - Implement proper password hashing and security measures

## Implementation Notes

- The current authentication method is temporary and NOT suitable for production
- The admin dashboard should follow the visual style of the main game
- All admin functions should have proper error handling
- Code should be well-documented for future maintenance

## Database Schema Reference

```sql
-- Users table
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    last_login TIMESTAMP,
    is_admin BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);

-- Sessions table
CREATE TABLE sessions (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    token VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    expires_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Games table
CREATE TABLE games (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    score INTEGER NOT NULL,
    completed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    movies_played JSONB,
    wrong_guesses INTEGER
);
```
